# Social-Network-API
An API for a social network web application using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 

Our task was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. We used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

We had to meet the following criteria:
```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

```
- **What was your motivation?**
```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

```
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
I built this project to practice using MongoDB, Mongoose and APIs.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows user creation as well as the ability to add thoughts/posts, add friends and reactions/comments.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to take what I knew about SQL/relational database structure and apply it to a non-relational/NoSQL structure with its own controllers, models, routes and ODM.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
Connecting to Mongo.
  
 
 ## Usage
 This application has not been deployed. An overview video of the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes being used in Insomnia locally is linked below.
